How to contribute to PAM
==========================

Did you find a bug? Run into an error?
-----------------------------------------

* **Check that you are on the newest version of the code.**
    * If you are on the *master* branch, check whether the problem has been resolved on the *develop* branch.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the [Issues](https://gitlab.com/PAM-PIE/PAM/issues) on GitLab.
* If you did not find an open issue relating to your problem, [open a new issue](https://gitlab.com/PAM-PIE/PAM/issues/new).
    * Make sure that you use a **clear title and description** of your problem.
    * Include as much relevant information as possible, e.g. what did you do that caused the problem?
    * Post the **error message**.
    
Did you fix a bug?
--------------------

* Small and obvious bug fixes (i.e. syntax errors, typos) may be directly performed on the *develop* branch.
    * Simply commit your changes with a **clear message** and push to the remote.
* Generally, it is best practice to create a *bugfix* branch from *develop* to work on fixing a particular issue.
    * Once the bug is fixed on your *bugfix* branch, submit a merge request detailing you changes and await approval/feedback.

Do you want to work on a larger feature or addition to PAM?
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Follow the same workflow as for bugfixes by creating a *feature* branch.
* Once your feature is finished, submit a merge request.
